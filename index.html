      <h2>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to PARKOUR LABS. Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us at Pdpartid@games.
      </p>
      <p>
        This privacy policy explains how we handle information in our virtual reality application available on the Meta Quest Store.
      </p>
      <p>
        The summary is very simple: <strong>We do not collect, store, use, or share any personal data from our users.</strong>
        Your gaming experience is entirely yours and stays on your device.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Personal Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
      <p>
        To be absolutely clear, when we say we do not collect personal data, we mean that we do not request or have access to
        any type of information that could identify you. This includes, but is not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name, username, or email address</li>
        <li>Device data such as IP address or unique device identifiers</li>
        <li>Game statistics, achievements, or gameplay actions</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Audio or video recordings</li>
        <li>Information from your Meta account or Horizon profile</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Everything that happens in PARKOUR LABS stays on your Meta Quest headset.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Processing</h2>
      <p>
        Since we do not collect any data, there is nothing to process, handle, or use.
        The application operates autonomously on your device without sending any personal
        information to our servers or to those of third parties.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Third Parties</h2>
      <p>
        We do not integrate analytics tools, advertising, or third-party services into our
        application that would collect data on our behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
        To download and run the game, you use Meta’s services. Meta may collect data according
        to its own policies. For example, cloud saves are managed by Meta and are subject to
        their privacy policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recommend reviewing Meta’s Privacy Policy to understand how they manage your data.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Deletion Requests</h2>
      <p>
        In accordance with Meta’s guidelines, users must have a clear way to request the deletion
        of their data. Since we do not collect or store any personal data, there is no data for us
        to delete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Game information is stored locally on your device and can be removed by uninstalling
        the application.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        We respect the privacy of children. Our application does not knowingly collect any personal
        information from any user, including children.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use of Meta Quest devices is subject to Meta’s Terms, which specify a minimum age for users.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Although we do not anticipate changes due to our no-data-collection policy, if future
        updates introduce features that require data collection, this policy will be updated
        clearly and prominently.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will be informed of any changes before continuing to use the application.
      </p>
